## Description

This project allowed me to practice cleaning up code and making sure it functions correctly. I built this project so that I could fine-tune my skills of creating accessible webpages to assist people who have disabilities. I also wanted to learn how to increase the webpage's search engine optimization. The problem solved is accessibility and search engine optimization by adding semantics, alt attributes and being as descriptive as possible. I learned how increasing the efficiency of the css file creates a long-term sustainabile codebase. Also, how accessibility actually make a webpage rank higher on a search engine and help people with disabilities. There are technical things I learned, such as, combining selectors and ordering semantics throughout my code.
